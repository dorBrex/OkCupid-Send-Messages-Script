## Features

- Connects to your personal OkCupid account
- Save your cookies and personal authentication information only on your own local-machine n the UserData folder - no one else will be able to see it. We're keeping your privacy 100% safe.
- At the end of the script-run, generates a list with the name, location and age of each user you sent a message to.
- Handles exceptions and errors on the UI of OkCupid site
- Pass and delete user with full inbox.
- Reconnecting to your user with your personal info, without sharing it, and without repeating writing it over and over.
- print each stage and act to your terminal/ cli.

## Tech & Installation

The Cupid Swindler uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Python] - Python 3.4+ to run the script on your computer
- [Pycharm] - Free IDE - text editor and developers environment in order to edit the script.
- [Git Bash] - A program to clone the repo from github to your local machine.
- [Chrome Web Driver] - Download it from the original site and make sure to put it in the same folder as the rest of the repo (project) otherwise the script won't run.
- Create an empty UserData folder on your desktop


And of course CupidSwindler itself is open source with a [public repository][CupidSwindler]
 on GitHub.
