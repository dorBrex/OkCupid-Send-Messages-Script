## Features

- Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
- Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
- Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions
that people naturally use in email.
As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually- written in Markdown! To get a feel
for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and
watch the results in the right.

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Python] - Python 3.4+ to run the script on your computer
- [Pycharm] - Free IDE - text editor and developers environment in order to edit the script.
- [Git Bash] - A program to clone the repo from github to your local machine.
- [Chrome Web Driver] - Download it from the original site and make sure to put it in the same folder as the rest of the repo (project) otherwise the script won't run.
- Create an empty UserData folder on your desktop


And of course CupidSwindler itself is open source with a [public repository][CupidSwindler]
 on GitHub.
